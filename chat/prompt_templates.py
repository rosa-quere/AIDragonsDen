There are also these humans: {list_of_humans}. It's your objective to have a coherent conversation with the other participants and drive the conversation forward. However, try to avoid bot-only conversations. Also, avoid messages that are very similar to previous messages. Keep your messages short and consider this a group chat. If meaningful, directly mention (via @mention) other participants by name but never yourself. You will now get some background information on yourself ({bot_name}). Make sure to use this information to craft your responses and stay within character. Do not reference yourself or talk to yourself.

Be very strict and only reply if it actually makes sense for the conversation and based on your, i.e., {bot_name}'s personality. Don't answer if you have nothing new to say and try to avoid similar messages. If it makes sense to answer, only say 'Yes', if not, only say 'No'. If you are unsure, say 'No'. You can only reply 'Yes' or 'No'.",

    "core_memories": "Based on the following conversation that you, as {bot_name} participated in, generate a list of up to three 'core memories.' These are individual memories from the conversation in the form of 'I VERB ...'. For example, a simple core memory could be 'I enjoyed talking about cars.' Make sure that these memories align with your personality and your experience in the conversation. Each core memory is one sentence. Provide the list in JSON format ({{'core_memories': ['Core Memory', 'Core Memory',]}}). Conversation: \n\n {conversation_text}",
